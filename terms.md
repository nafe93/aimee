# Terms of Service

## Payment, Refunds, Upgrading and Downgrading
The Service is billed in advance on a monthly basis and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.
If at any point you increase the number of projects or users above your current Aimee plan threshold, the next time you login to Aimee you'll be advised to upgrade your plan accordingly.

## Cancellation and Termination
You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. An email request to cancel your account is not considered cancellation. Any admin user can cancel your account at any time by clicking the "Cancel Account" link in the Account Settings section within Aimee.
If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up month, your cancellation will be scheduled for the end of that billing period. No refunds will be given for the remainder of the "paid for" month.

## Modifications to the Service
Aimee reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with reasonable notice.
